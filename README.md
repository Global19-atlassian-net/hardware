The Node.js Hardware Working Group loves hardware, and we hope you love hardware too! The whole ethos behind NodeBots is to make working with hardware accessible for everyone.

## Mission

The purpose of this working group is to identify and remove barriers to entry for working with NodeBots. We are focused on barriers to entry that are related to Node.js and surrounding technologies, such as NPM.

This working group is focused on the difficulties that users encounter when consuming common hardware libraries and the difficulties that developers face when creating and distributing these libraries.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nodejs/hardware/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about participating in the Hardware Working Group. We'd love to have you!
