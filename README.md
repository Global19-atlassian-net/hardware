The Node.js Hardware Working Group loves robots, and we hope you love them too! The whole ethos behind NodeBots is to make robotics accessible for everyone.

## Mission

Our purpose is to identify and remove barriers to entry for working with NodeBots. We are focused on barriers to entry that are related to Node.js and surrounding technologies, such as NPM.

We focus on difficulties that users encounter when consuming common robotics libraries, primarily [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/), and difficulties that developers encounter when creating and distributing these libraries.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nodejs/hardware/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about participating in the Hardware Working Group.
