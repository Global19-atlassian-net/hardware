Contributing to the Node.js Hardware Working Group
==================================================

So you're interested in helping the Hardware Working Group, that's awesome!

The Hardware Working Group is an open working group, i.e. there is no official membership roster. If you want to participate, just join in!

The Hardware Working Group uses two communications mechanisms: [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nodejs/hardware/issues) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/nodejs/hardware), a chat system similar to IRC but based around GitHub.

If you're interesting in participating, hop on in to Gitter and say hi! We'll let you know how and where to help from there.
