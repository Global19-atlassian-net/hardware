Contributing to the Node.js Hardware Working Group
==================================================

So you're interested in helping the Hardware Working Group, that's awesome!

The Hardware Working Group (WG) is an open WG. While we do have official WG members, their role is limited. If you want to participate in a meaningful way, just join in!

## How To Contribute

The Hardware WG uses two communications mechanisms for all of our work.

All official work is done via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nodejs/hardware/issues). All documentation and initiatives are cataloged here, as well as some discussion of these topics. Discussion in these issues should be kept on-topic and brief to the extend possible, because these issues serve as documentation, as well as collaboration.

We also use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/nodejs/hardware), a chat system similar to IRC but based around GitHub. Gitter is used for all sorts of chat, from formulating raw ideas, to more free-form discussion of specific issues, to posting funny robot videos and cat gifs.

If you're interesting in participating, hop on in to Gitter and say hi! We'll give you some ideas on how and where you can help.

## Working Group Members

For the purposes of this document, a WG member is a person identified as a member by the [Node.js TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/).

In practice, a WG member has the following rights and responsibilities

* Commit access to this repository
* Listed as a point of contact for people if they are experiencing [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) issues

The current list of members is maintained [here](./MEMBERS.md).

If you are interesting in becoming a member, ping the group in the Gitter channel.

## Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.0

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

* (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
  have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated
  in the file; or
* (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
  of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license
  and I have the right under that license to submit that work with
  modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the
  same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a
  different license), as indicated in the file; or
* (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
  person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

## Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is adapted from [Rust's
CoC](http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html).

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
  environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
  disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.
* Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
  might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every
  design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous
  costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
  ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone.  That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term
  "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of
  Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of
  clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
  their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
  excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if
  you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable
  by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any
  of the [WG members](./MEMBERS.md) immediately with a capture (log, photo, email) of
  the harassment if possible.  Whether you're a regular contributor or
  a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you
  and we've got your back.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other
  attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
* Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or
  documentation. There is no need to address persons when explaining
  code (e.g. "When the developer")
